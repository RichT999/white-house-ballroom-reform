# White House Ballroom Reform

**Public archive documenting donor-funded White House renovations, symbolic erasure, and systemic reform.**

This repository hosts the civic artifact suite and reform proposal known as *Ballroom Before the Fall*. It documents the demolition of the White House East Wing and its replacement with a privately funded, 999-person ballroom ‚Äî executed without full regulatory review.

The archive includes:
- Multi-panel exhibit: *Ballroom Before the Fall*
- Donor corridor map: bundler-to-ballroom continuum
- Kinetic swing chamber model: phase-space collapse
- Mythic overlays: Babylonian banquet, Tower of Babel
- Legislative proposal: *Architectural Integrity & Donor Transparency Act (AIDTA)*

Explore the archive, contribute feedback, and help restore boundaries between public trust assets and private influence.
